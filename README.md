# SO_LONG

In the so_long project, I developed a simple 2D game where a player must navigate a maze, collect items, and avoid obstacles.

• I used the MiniLibX library to create graphics and visual interactions, including sprite rendering, window manipulation, and keyboard event handling.

• I added a map verification to ensure the correct map type, checking if the map is closed and if it has the ".ber" extension. If there is an error in the map, such as a closed map, an error message is displayed.

• I used a Makefile to facilitate the compilation and execution process of the game.

• In addition to the basic project requirements, I implemented extra features such as a life system, a timer, enemies, and the ability to accept multiple maps.
